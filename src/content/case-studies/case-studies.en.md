cases:
  - name: Industrial Equipment Failure Prediction at HighTech Manufacturing
    logo: /img/case-study1.jpg
    description: Improving factory efficiency for a large industrial company using data analytics and predictive modeling.
    challenges: HighTech Manufacturing, a large manufacturing company, was experiencing issues with inefficient equipment maintenance, including unplanned production disruptions, high repair costs, and inadequate equipment uptime. Their maintenance practices were mostly reactive rather than preventive.
    solutions: We developed a comprehensive predictive maintenance strategy, integrated manufacturing data from disparate systems into a centralized data lake, developed predictive maintenance models using machine learning, created real-time dashboards for maintenance teams, and trained in-house staff on data maintenance and model updates.
    results: Results achieved - 37% reduction in unplanned downtime, €420K annual savings, and 15% increase in OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness).
  
  - name: Data Governance Transformation at MediServe Clinics
    logo: /img/case-study2.jpg
    description: Improving healthcare data quality and governance for a network of clinics.
    challenges: MediServe, a growing network of 12 private clinics, was experiencing data quality issues impacting patient care and compliance. They lacked a unified view of patients, had inconsistent data entry practices, and were concerned about GDPR compliance.
    solutions: We assigned a part-time CDO who worked with their team to create and implement a comprehensive data governance framework, develop a master data management system for patient records, standardize data collection and entry procedures across clinics, establish privacy-by-design protocols for GDPR compliance, and train staff on data quality best practices.
    results: Results achieved - 92% reduction in data errors, 100% GDPR compliance, and 23% faster reporting.
  
  - name: Customer Analytics Program at StyleTrend Retail
    logo: /img/case-study3.jpg
    description: Creating personalized marketing strategies for an online fashion retailer.
    challenges: StyleTrend, an online fashion retailer with 50 employees, wanted to improve customer retention and increase average order value. They had abundant customer data but lacked the expertise to turn this data into effective marketing actions.
    solutions: Our CDO team collaborated with their marketing and IT teams to create a unified view of customer profiles from disparate data sources, develop a customer segmentation model based on purchasing behavior, implement a personalized recommendation engine translated into automated email campaigns, and build user-friendly dashboards for marketing decision-making.
    results: Results achieved - 32% increase in repeat purchases, 18% increase in average order value, and €280K additional annual revenue.
  
  - name: Risk Analytics and Compliance Automation at SmartFin
    logo: /img/case-study4.jpg
    description: Automating regulatory compliance and risk assessment for financial services.
    challenges: SmartFin, a medium-sized peer-to-peer lending platform, was facing growing regulatory compliance requirements and the need to improve credit risk assessment. Their manual handling of compliance processes was becoming unsustainable, and their credit scoring models weren't sophisticated enough.
    solutions: We provided strategic and technical support to develop an automated compliance monitoring system with comprehensive reporting, enhance credit risk models using advanced machine learning approaches, implement data quality management systems at critical data points, and train their analytics team to support the new models.
    results: Results achieved - 65% reduction in compliance work, 22% reduction in credit losses, and 8% growth in new loan volume.
